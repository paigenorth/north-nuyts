## examples of CGATs and EnrGATs

### CGAT has two sorts: Circle for sets and Triangle for cats
- Sys Fω
- MTT
- BCM/CH ; TraSCwoD
- QTT
- dual context MTT
- Fitch style MTT
- linear/affine simple TT
- subtyping?
---
- operad + action on category
  
   - transl for Andreas: single obj multicategory + multifunctor to a monoidal category
   - (Paige isn't saying this is a good idea)
- action of a monoidal category on a category
- (profunctor on a cat)
- (fibration on a cat)

### EnrGAT has a bunch of sorts, generally
- is Set special?
---
- any EAT internal to a category, amounts to reinterpreting the sort
----
- enriched categories
- interesting enriched categories
- gluing arguments for metatheoretic proofs?
- (T-multicategories?)
---
- a LF on an existing type system (use a sort for the existing system)?
- polymorphism (& parametricity) for an existing type system?
- (secure compilation??)

## signature language & semantics
- axiomatize what we use to build the semantics
- interpret in the
  - CwF of categories
  - CwF of CwFs
  - any other CwF (if you want to gather your models into some abstract structure)
    (it probably has to have opposites and twisted arrow categories...)
    - e.g. the context (X : Circle) is interpreted as Set \in Cat
    - the context (X : V) with V self-enriched is interpreted as V \in VCat
    - the context (X : Triangle) is interpreted as Cat \in 2Cat
- think about syntax
- do whatever else Kaposi et al. do
