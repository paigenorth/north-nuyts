## examples of CGATs and EnrGATs

### CGAT has two sorts: Circle for sets and Triangle for cats
- Sys FÏ‰
- MTT
- BCM/CH ; TraSCwoD
- QTT
- dual context MTT
- Fitch style MTT
- linear/affine simple TT
- subtyping?
---
- operad + action on category
  
   - transl for Andreas: single obj multicategory + multifunctor to a monoidal category
   - (Paige isn't saying this is a good idea)
- action of a monoidal category on a category
- (profunctor on a cat)
- (fibration on a cat)

### EnrGAT has a bunch of sorts, generally
- is Set special?
----
- enriched categories
- interesting enriched categories
- (T-multicategories?)
---
- a LF on an existing type system (use a sort for the existing system)?
- polymorphism (& parametricity) for an existing type system?
- (secure compilation??)
